# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?



Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

## WeatherPy

Creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

Objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Final notebook have:

* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.

As final considerations:

* Completed analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* Used the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
* Includes a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Used proper labeling of your plots
